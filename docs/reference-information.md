## Command Line utilities  

### wfica
  
You can use a connection file simply by typing its name after wfica without any of the options below.  

| To | Type |
|---|---|
| Specify the custom connection to use from the Connection file. <br><br>**Note**: With the new self-service UI, you cannot set up a custom connection in this way. | `-desc description`| 
| Specify the custom connection to use from the Connection file. <br><br>**Note**: With the new self-service UI, you cannot set up a custom connection in this way. | `-description` |
| Specify a desktop file. | `-desktop filename` |
| Specify a connection file.  | `-file connection_filename` |
| Set alternative protocol file. This enables the use of an alternative module.ini. |   `-protocolfile filename` |
| Set alternative client configuration file. This enables the use of an alternative wfclient.ini. | `-clientfile filename` |
| Display a different name for Workspace app, specified by name, wherever that name appears. The default name is the device name. However, if you use a Sunray device, the default name is derived from the device's MAC address. This is overridden by the ClientName entry in .ICAClient/wfclient.ini, which is itself overridden by issuing the - clientname option. | `-clientname name`  | 
| Show this list of parameters. | `-help`  |
| Display version information.  | `-version` |  
| Show error numbers and string.  | `-errno` |  
| Set the location of Workspace app installation files. This is equivalent to setting the ICAROOT environment variable. | `-icaroot directory` |  
| Suppress connection dialogs.  | `-quiet` |  
| Enable key logging.  | `-keylog` |
| Set session geometry.  | `-geometry WxH+X+Y` |
| Set color depth. | `-depth <4 | 8 | 16 | 24 | auto>` | 
| Set monitor spanning. | `-span [h][o][a| mon1[,mon2[,mon3,mon4]]]`  |
| Use private color map.  | `-private` |

| Turn on sound. | `-sound` |
| Turn off sound. | `-nosound` |
| Set drive mapping overrides. These are of the form `A$=path`, where path can contain an environment variable (for example `A$=$HOME/tmp`). This option must be repeated for each drive to be overridden. For the override to work, there must be an existing mapping, though it need not be enabled. | `-drivemap string` |

### storebrowse 
 
The following table documents the options that you can use with the storebrowse utility.  

| Option | Description | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `-a`, `--addstore` | Adds a new store | To add a store, the operation accepts an incomplete URL and tries possible stores, using default names, until it finds one that exists. Whenever it adds a store it reports the complete URL. <br><br> With this release, other operations that require a store can implicitly add the store in addition to their main function, provided that they are given the complete URL for the store. |
| `-E`, `--enumerate` | Enumerates the available resources. | By default, the resource name, display name, and folder of the resource are displayed. Additional information can be displayed, by using the `--details` option. |
| `-e`, `--listerrorcodes` | Lists error codes.  | |
| `-S`, `--subscribed` | Lists the subscribed resources. | By default, the resource name, display name, and folder of the resource are displayed. Additional information can be displayed using the `--details` option. |
| `-M`, `--details` <br><br> Use in conjunction with the `-E` or `-S` option. | Selects which attributes of published applications are returned. This option takes an argument that is the sum of the numbers corresponding to the required details: <br><br> Publisher(0x1), VideoType(0x2), SoundType(0x4), AppInStartMenu(0x8), AppOnDesktop(0x10), AppIsDesktop(0x20), AppIsDisabled(0x40), WindowType(0x80), WindowScale(0x100), and DisplayName(0x200). <br><br> CreateShortcuts(0x100000) can be used in conjunction with `-S`, `-s`, and `-u` to create menu entries for subscribed applications. <br><br> RemoveShortcuts(0x20000 0) can be used with `-S` to delete all menu entries. | Some of these details are not available through storebrowse. If this is the case, the output is 0. Values can also be expressed in decimal as well as hexadecimal (for example, 512 for 0x200). |
| `-v`, `--version` | Writes the version number of storebrowse to the standard output. | |
| `-?`,  `-h`, `--help` | Lists the usage for storebrowse. | An abbreviated version of this table is displayed.  |
| `-U`,  `--username` | Passes the user name to the server. | These options work with Program Neighborhood Agent sites and StoreFront sites. When used with a StoreFront site, the site must be configured to support HTTP Basic authentication, otherwise, these options are ignored. |
| `-P`,  `--password` | Passes the password to the server. | These options work with Program Neighborhood Agent sites and StoreFront sites. When used with a StoreFront site, the site must be configured to support HTTP Basic authentication, otherwise, these options are ignored. |
| `-D`, `--domain` | Passes the domain to the server.  | These options work with Program Neighborhood Agent sites and StoreFront sites. When used with a StoreFront site, the site must be configured to support HTTP Basic authentication, otherwise, these options are ignored. |
| `-r`, `--icaroot` | Specifies the root directory of the Citrix Workspace app for Linux installation. | If not specified, the value is taken from the ICAROOT environment variable or determined at run time. |
| `-i`, `--icons` <br><br> Use in conjunction with the `-E` or `-S` option. | Fetches desktop or application icons, in PNG format, of the size and depth given by the best or size argument. <br><br> If the best argument is used, the best sized icon available on the server is fetched. You can convert this to any size required. The best argument is the most efficient for storage and bandwidth, and can simplify scripting. <br><br> If the size argument is used, an icon is fetched of the specified size and depth. <br><br> In both cases, icons are saved in a file for each of the resources that the `–E` or `-S` option returns. | The `best` argument creates an icon of the form `<resource name>`.png. <br><br> The size argument is of the form WxB, where W is the width of the icon (all icons are square, so only one value is needed to specify the size), and B is the color depth (that is, the number of bits per pixel). W is required but B is optional. If it is not specified, icons of all available image depths are fetched for that size. The files that are created are named `<resource name>_WxWxB.png`.  |
| `-u`, 	`--unsubscribe` | Unsubscribes the specified resource from the given store. | |  
| `-s`, `--subscribe` | Subscribes the specified resource from the given store. | If you use a different Workspace app, subscriptions on Program Neighborhood Agent servers are unavailable.  |

**Important**: The unique gateway

| Option | Description | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `-d`, `--deletestore` | Deregisters a store with the Service Record daemon. | |
| `-c`, `--configselfservice` | Gets and sets the self- service UI settings that are stored in StoreCache.ctx. Takes an argument of the form `<entry[=value]>`. If only entry is present, the setting's current value is printed. If a value is present, it is used to configure the setting. | **Example**: `storebrowse --configselfservice SharedUserMode=True` <br><br> **Important**: Both entry and value are case sensitive. Commands that use this option will fail if the case is different to the documented case of the setting itself (in StoreCache.ctx). |  
| `-C`, `--addCR` | Reads the provided Citrix Workspace app (CR) file, and prompts the user to add each store.  | The output is the same as `–a`, but might contain more than one store, separated by newlines. |
| `-K`, `--killdaemon` | Terminates the storebrowse daemon process.  | All credentials and tokens are purged. The SSO credentials inserted last are also removed. |

### Pnabrowse  

**Important**: The pnabrowse utility is deprecated but can still query Program Neighborhood Agent sites for lists of servers and published resources, and lets you connect to a published resource. Citrix discourages the use of pnabrowse because it prevents users from accessing StoreFront stores; use storebrowse instead. storebrowse can prompt for credentials from both sites and stores. The `-U`, `-P` and `-D` options only work with Program Neighborhood Agent sites. 

An optional argument of pnabrowse specifies the server to connect to. This may be either:  

* The name of the XenApp server, for options -S and -A.  
* The URL of the server running a Program Neighborhood Agent site, for options -E and -L.  

The pnabrowse utility returns an exit value indicating success or failure, and can use the following options with XenApp.  
 
| Option | Description | 
|---|---|
| `-S` | List servers, one per line. | 
| `-A` | List published applications, one per line.  |
| `-m` | Used in conjunction with `-A`, this expands the information returned about published applications to include Publisher, Video Type, Sound Type, AppInStartMenu, AppOnDesktop, AppIsDesktop, AppIsDisabled, Window Type, WindowScale, and Display Name. |
| `-M` | Used in conjunction with -A, this selects individual columns of information returned about published applications. It takes an argument (1-1023) which is the sum of the numbers corresponding to the required details: Publisher(1), Video Type(2), Sound Type(4), AppInStartMenu(8), AppOnDesktop(16), AppIsDesktop(32), AppIsDisabled(64), Window Type(128), Window Scale(256), and DisplayName(512). |
| `-c` | When appended to option `-A`, create files specifying the minimum information the client engine needs to connect to published applications; for example, application name, browse server, window resolution, color depth, audio, and encryption settings. File names are formatted as follows: /tmp/xxx\_1.ica, /tmp/xxx\_2.ica where xxx is replaced by the decimal process identifier for the pnabrowse process. | 
| `-d` | Used in conjunction with -L to specify the XDG desktop file. |  
| `-e` | Shows error numbers. |
| `-i` | Include paths to files containing icon images for published applications in the output from option -A. Either .xpm or .png files are returned depending on the use of the size (WxB) option: <br><br> -i returns 16x16 icons in XPM format at 4 bits per pixel <br><br> -iWxB returns WxW icons in PNG format at B bits per pixel | 
| `-f` | Include Citrix XenApp folder names for published applications in the output from option -A. | 
| `-u` | Specify a user name for authenticating the user to a proxy server.  |
| `-p` | Specify a password for authenticating the user to a proxy server.  |

The following options provide Citrix XenApp (Program Neighborhood Agent) Service functionality and can be used with both XenApp and XenDesktop.  

| Option | Description | 
|---|---|
| `-E` | Invoke Citrix XenApp and enumerate all published resources. <br><br> If you specify both -E and -L, the last option on the command line takes effect. The utility then terminates, possibly leaving a connection open. <br><br> For each resource the following details are written to standard output, enclosed in single quotation marks and separated by tab characters: <br><br> **Name**: The display name from the Access Management Console Application Properties dialog box. <br><br>**Folder**: The Program Neighborhood folder from the Access Management Console Application Properties dialog box.<br><br> **Type**: Either Application or Content.<br><br> **Icon**: The full path name of an .xpm format icon file.  |
| `-L` | Specify the name of the published resource to which you want to connect. This invokes Citrix XenApp and launches a connection to a published resource. If you specify both -E and -L, the last option on the command line takes effect. The utility then terminates, possibly leaving a connection open. |
| `-N` | Specify a new password. This option must be used with existing credentials and is valid only when the existing password has expired, as indicated by the exit code 238: PASSWORD\_EXPIRED\_OR\_MUST\_CHANGE. |
| `-P` | Specify a password for authenticating the user to the server running the Web Interface or the server running the Citrix XenApp (Program Neighborhood Agent) Service. | 
| `-U` | Specify a user name for authenticating the user to the server running the Web Interface or the server running the Citrix XenApp (Program Neighborhood Agent) Service. | 
| `-D` | Specify a domain for authenticating the user to the server running the Web Interface or the server running the Citrix XenApp (Program Neighborhood Agent) Service. | 
| `-WD` | Disconnects all active sessions for the user.  | 
| `-WT` | Terminates all sessions for the user.  |
| `-Wr` | Reconnects to all disconnected sessions for the user.  |
| `-WR` | Reconnects to all sessions (active or disconnected) for the user. | 
| `-k` | Use an existing Kerberos ticket to authenticate, rather than user name, password, and domain. This requires configuration of the client and server. It is applicable only for pnabrowse. |

The following common options are used:  

| Option | Description | 
|---|---|
| -q | Quiet mode; do not print error messages.  |
| -r  | Include raw icon data for published applications in the output from options - E or -A. |  
| -V | Displays version details.  |
| -h | Print a usage message listing the options.  |
| -? | Print a usage message listing the options.  |

### Exit Status values 
 
The command-line utilities storebrowse and pnabrowse report exit status values to indicate success or failure. If problems arise, these values give guidance on possible error causes and their meanings, and are listed in the following table. Note that some error conditions may result in different exit values depending on which part of the code detects them. 

| Value  | Description  |
|---|---|
| 0 | Success |
| 1-242  | These error codes are associated with common error messages. Run pnabrowse -errno for a list of these messages. | 
| 246 | Citrix XenApp has reported an error. See the text written to standard output for more information on this error. | 
| 247 | A published resource has not been recognized. |  
| 248 | Invalid credentials.  |
| 249 | Failed to enumerate servers. |
| 250 | Failed to make a directory.  |
| 251 | Failed to load a .ini file.  |
| 252 | No Web Interface server was specified.  |
| 253 | No Program Neighborhood Agent server was specified. |
| 254 | A parameter is missing  |
| 255 | Execution failed  |

When pnabrowse fails to change a password, the exit code can be useful in diagnosing the problem. For example:  

```
0 SUCCESS  
4 E_MISSING_ARG  
63 E_NOT_ALLOWED WI configuration prohibits change  
65 E_NOT_SUPPORTED Could be seen if :-  
-	WI config requires “direct connection” (=Kerberos), but couldn’t load Kerberos library  
-	Support is not compiled into client - might see it with pre 11.114 version  
-	Trying to change a Novell password    
74 E_NEW_PASSWORD_INVALID  
248 EX_INVALID_CREDENTIALS  
255 EX_EXEC_FAILED Some problem with the server changing the password, such as it hasn’t expired. 
```

##  Configuration files
  
For any given connection, the configuration files are checked in a specific order. For details, see Configuration files earlier in this document.  

### wfclient.ini  

This .ini file contains a section for parameters specific to the Workspace app user interface (UI), such as version number and desired resolution.  

In Version 10.x and later of Workspace app for Linux, for each entry in wfclient.ini, there must be a corresponding entry in All\_Regions.ini for the setting to take effect. In addition, for each entry in the [Thinwire3.0], [ClientDrive], and [TCP/IP] sections of wfclient.ini, there must be a corresponding entry in canonicalization.ini for the setting to take effect. See the All\_Regions.ini and canonicalization.ini files in the $ICAROOT/config/ directory for more information.

### Parameter syntax  

Boolean parameters use Yes, True, 1, or On to indicate TRUE. Any other values, including No, False, 0, or Off, are interpreted as FALSE.
  
For all parameters, spaces are significant and values are case-sensitive. 
 
Parameters marked as ignored are not currently used by the client, but can be reserved for future use, redundant, or used by other clients; for example, Win32 or Macintosh. In the last case, the parameter is read by the client but the result is discarded.  

Default values are embedded into the client program itself. Fixed values are set by the unmodified .ini configuration files. 
 
In the following table, the parameters are listed alphabetically within each section of the file. 

| Item | Description |
|---|---|
| `[WFClient]` | The engine uses this section. It contains default session oriented parameters. |
| `AllowAudioInput=boolean`  |	To enable the webcam and audio input for connections, you must ensure this parameter is set to True; otherwise, it overrides the setting for the EnableAudioInput parameter in appsrv.ini. Default=False | 
| `ApplySucConnTimeoutToDesk tops=boolean` | Works with the SucConnTimeout setting. Ensures that the setting SucConnTimeout is honored by virtual desktops as well as virtual applications. When `ApplySucConnTimeoutToDesktops` is applied to desktops, repeated clicks open multiple sessions, but you can set `SucConnTimeout` to a suitable timeout and run a custom script in between the desktop launches. Default=False |
| `AutoResponse=integer`  |	Specifies a bitmapped value that enables automatic response to user prompts (such as dialog boxes). The values are as follows: 1: log message to standard error output; 2: exit program whenever that choice is offered. Default=0 (wait for user response). |

### module.ini  

This file contains a comprehensive listing of parameters used to select and configure the communications stack modules. The section headings identify the target module by name. The stack element types are:  

* Transport Drivers (TD) - manage the communications connection. 
* Protocol Drivers (PD) - manage intermediate data stream filters.  
* WinStation Drivers (WD) - manage the presentation data stream. 
* Virtual Drivers (VD) - manage ICA protocol extensions.  

These elements are all loaded depending on the user configuration and the required stack relationships. The transport driver is loaded first, then protocol drivers, the WinStation driver, and virtual drivers. Each of the supported types has a section that describes the module name and default parameters. Most parameters in this file are defaults. They can be overridden by equivalent entries in appsrv.ini, an ICA file or All\_Regions.ini. 

### Parameter syntax  

Boolean parameters use Yes, True, 1, or On to indicate TRUE. Any other values, including No, False, 0, or Off, are interpreted as FALSE.  

For all parameters, spaces are significant and values are case-sensitive.  

Those marked as ignored are not currently used by the client, but can be reserved for future use, are redundant, or are used by other clients; for example, Win32 or Macintosh. In the last case, the parameter is read by the client but the result discarded. 
 
Default values are embedded into the client program itself. Fixed values are set by the unmodified .ini configuration files. 
 
Note: The values in module.ini are not affected by those in All\_Regions.ini in the same way that values from other configuration files are. This is because the same permissions are required to change both files.  

In the following table, the parameters are listed alphabetically within each section of the file.

### reg.ini  

reg.ini contains Citrix XenApp configuration settings. It is written by pnabrowse so it does not exist immediately after a typical installation. reg.ini provides initial values to pnabrowse that you can override through command-line arguments.  

**Important**: reg.ini works with pnabrowse only. It has no effect on the deployments involving storebrowse or selfservice.  

You may prefer to have a password in reg.ini, because this file has restricted read permission, rather than have it appearing on the command line. To do this, change  
`lastSavePassword=REG_DWORD:0` to `lastSavePassword=REG_DWORD:1`, and append the 
password using basic encryption to `lastPassword=REG_SZ:`.  

This allows pnabrowse to run without the -P option. To do this, you must also omit the `-U` and `D` options. pnabrowse continues to be governed by config.xml and therefore may reset these entries if the Web Interface does not have the authentication method properties set to allow the user to save the password.  

### Other configuration files

The `$ICAROOT/config/` directory also contains several other .ini files, including All\_Regions.ini, canonicalization.ini, regions.ini, Trusted\_Region.ini, Unknown\_Region.ini, and Untrusted\_Region.ini. These files offer administrators an alternative way to configure the client settings described in previous sections. The files also allow administrators to configure client selective trust, a security feature that restricts the characteristics of an ICA session depending on the server to which the client connects.   

For more information, see the configuration files in the `$ICAROOT/config/` directory.
