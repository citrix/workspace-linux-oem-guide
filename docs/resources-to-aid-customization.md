# Resources to aid customization 
 
OEMs can make use of the following: 
 
* Citrix Receiver for Linux, which is available for download from the Citrix website, [http://www.citrix.com/](http://www.citrix.com/).  
* Two command-line utilities: storebrowse, and wfica:  
	* `storebrowse` is equivalent to the deprecated pnabrowse utility. It queries Citrix StoreFront for virtual desktops and published applications.  
	* `wfica` is the client engine that creates connections to the server and performs all of the functions of the connections.  
* A series of .ini configuration files that allow you to customize the behavior of individual connections or users.  
* Certain library files (.dll or .so files) that can be added to or removed from the default installation to enable or disable specific functionality.
